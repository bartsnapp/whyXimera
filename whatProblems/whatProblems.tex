There are several issues that we have identified with the current
textbook and homework system.

\paragraph{Annual crashes and bugs}

The volume of students who take calculus 1 in the fall places enormous
stress on the servers provided by commerical publishers. For the last
several years, the online homework system for calculus has failed
within the first weeks of the course.  Moreover, commerical publishers
are slow to fix bugs/typos. The current solution for dealing with a
bug in the online homework is to ``not assign'' the faulty problem.


\paragraph{Adhering to other's content}

Instructor and coordinator control over content; ``no one wants to give someone else's speech''

\paragraph{Alignment of content to assessments}

Misalignment of commercial homework problems and our own exams


\paragraph{New additons}

Publishers release new editions at an approximate rate of a new
edition every 4 years. Each addition brings work for the instructors
and coordiantors. This work is typically mundane and
superficial. Instructors should be thinking about content, not section
numbers.


\paragraph{Outsourcing assessment}
Outsourcing assessment is outsourcing a core competency of the University


\paragraph{High costs}
While the mathematics department has done an excellent job negotiating
a lower price for textbooks, the cost is still quite high.  The least
expensive option for a students is to ``rent'' an online copy of the
textbook for \$30 per semester. 


\paragraph{Longevity}
Longevity (can students keep the textbook after the course is over)


\paragraph{Opaqueness}
The transparency (or rather opaqueness) of adaptive grading in commercial platforms

\paragraph{Grade data is unavailable}
Value of student grade data: we can't get all the data from the commercial publishers, but with our own platform, we get the data needed to do predictive analytics
