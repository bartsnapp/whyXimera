The yearly (August) server crash from the commercial publisher

Confusing student experience

Instructor and coordinator control over content; ``no one wants to give someone else's speech''

Misalignment of commercial homework problems and our own exams

New editions versus rolling release

Outsourcing assessment is outsourcing a core competency of the University

High cost to students (even if we charge a course fee, we can undercut commercial publishers)

Longevity (can students keep the textbook after the course is over)

The transparency (or rather opaqueness) of adaptive grading in commercial platforms

Value of student grade data: we can't get all the data from the commercial publishers, but with our own platform, we get the data needed to do predictive analytics
